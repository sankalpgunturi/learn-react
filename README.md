# My React Learning Experience

I took up this course from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) and I am documenting my learning experience here.

Scrimba gave me a good headstart to dive deep into the world of ReactJS. 

I am now taking up [CodeEvolution's ReactJS + Typescript course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiSGujM22OI&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwi1AXijGTKM0BKtHzVC-LSK).
